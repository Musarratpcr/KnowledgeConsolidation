# KnowledgeConsolidation

The repository contains source code and a steps by steps guide to get consolidated knowledge in Ripple Down Rules format. The repository containes two main foder 
structued  and unstructeud dealing with structured knoweldge acquistion and unstructued knowledge acquistion respectively.

# Structured Knowledge Acquistion

For structued knowledge acquisition we used Rapid Miner white box models (DT, J48, PART, and RIPPER )  to acquired knowledge. 
The knoweldge acquried for all three datasets used in our study are given in "SSM_DS Extracted Rules Raw", "PID-DS Extracted Rules Raw", 
and "CHD-DS Extracted Rules Raw" directories, respectively. The acquired knowledge/rules are transform into executable format presetned in "SSMDSRule.py", "PIDDSRules.py", 
and "CHDDSRules.py", respectively. These rules are initally used to evlaute the indivitual models performance, and later for knowledge combination, and consolidation.
